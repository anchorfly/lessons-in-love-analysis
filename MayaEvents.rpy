    "And it doesn’t help that the first of those is something that can never be explained. "
    "It’d be far too convenient for someone to come along and tell me why we’re here. What any of this is. How the only mystery bigger than the goal I’m meant to have is where I’ll wake up in the morning."
    "But someone did once. And beside me now is a girl who wears her skin. A hermit crab who found a pretty shell and crawled inside, not realizing that shell belonged to me."
    "Is it wrong to be possessive of something if that something was given to you? Is free will the dirt that muddies that question up? "
    "Because if it’s an issue of her wanting to leave one day, I don’t think that’d be an issue at all. And all it takes to find proof of that is one glance at how long she stayed."
    "And yes, this {i}can{/i} be seen as a prison — or something one can {i}not{/i} leave even if they want to. But there was a level of silent complacency I think we don’t think of often enough."
    "That same silence fills this room now, and it’s one more thing I don’t understand."
    "When I look into her eyes, I don’t understand what’s there either. Or what I’m meant to do despite having done this countless times before."
    "So we sit and we wait for something to happen, unsure of where we’ll wake up in the morning, but hoping it’s beside one another because that’s something familiar."
    "She breathes a sigh of relief. Or stress. Or exhaustion. And nudges my leg with hers like she’s poking a corpse with a stick to check for signs of life. "
    "And I’m here."
    "I nudge her back to prove that — buying time to find the words to the questions I must ask before consuming her. "
    "Is a room like this somewhere I can find them, though? And what dust or muck will cover them if pulled from beneath the bed?"
    "Could I cover her in them and still be awarded the same teasing smile she taunts me with whenever her body temperature rises?"
    "Or would knowing there is more to this than love bring it right back down?"
    "People — one more mystery I must accept. One more that can never be explained, no matter what scholars or con-men may tell you."
    "For we are beings who do strange, inexplicable things. Make wishes before understanding what it is that we really want. "

    "{i}That{/i} I understand. "

    "But what if it was?"
    "What would it look like?"
    "Because when Maya thinks of me, I hope there is no dim light. "
    "Nor vending machines packed with contraceptives. Dust in places hard to reach. "
