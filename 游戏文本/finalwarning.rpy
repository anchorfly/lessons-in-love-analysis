    a "There is a hidden element to it, and that element can be dumbed down to “the way a person is {i}made{/i} to see something.”"
    a "This raises the question of whether or not it’s truly “perception” at all at that point because, if you’re only seeing something because you’re {i}supposed{/i} to see it, are you really seeing anything at all?"
