    ya "Worse than they already are? With my frame cracking and the earth falling victim to its incessant rumbling?"

    s "None of it’s real, Yasu. None of {i}anything{/i} is real."

    ya "The lucky few would wear the skin of the unfortunate should it mean that the soles of their feet would even slightly resemble yours."

    s "And then what?"
    s "If I give you what you want and fill you with my {i}antidote,{/i} nothing changes. Those fears don’t go away. You don’t magically forget everything you’ve seen. "
    s "Conveniences like that always come with caveats. And chances are, the only difference you’ll feel when all is said and done is a dull pain between your legs and inescapable regret when you finally stumble back home."
    ya "Regret is not known to this one. There is simply no time for it. There is no time for anything anymore."

    ya "It is {i}we{/i} who rip each other apart — without the help of anyone. And it has already happened. "
    ya "We speak now in the esophagus of a dying beast. And our only options are to force the regurgitation of the parts of us that remain or smile and accept that we are sustenance."
