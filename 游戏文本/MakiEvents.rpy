    "It isn’t a new one, and this isn’t me saying it’s the first time I’ve heard it, but it {i}is{/i} the first time that I’ve ever tried to seriously make sense of it, for it’s something I can’t seem to wrap my head around."
    "{i}Love is in the air.{/i}"

    "Maybe I should start doing that."
    "Maybe covering my face would prevent me from falling for anyone who accidentally contaminates the air in the midst of some lukewarm debate on wires or the concept of breathing."
