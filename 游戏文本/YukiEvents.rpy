    "Sara’s giving her a job again. Tsubasa’s giving her {i}everything.{/i} And Yumi’s giving her the time of day, which I imagine is what Yuki wants more than those other things combined."

    yu "We were just kids when we bumped into each other for the first time. Think she was trying to run away from home or something."

    yu "Think all I did was scare her, though. Second I called out to her, she dropped her fancy ass handbag and told me I could take everything she had if I didn’t hurt her."
    yu "Turned out she got into a fight with her parents over an arranged marriage. Wasn’t even supposed to leave their mansion. "

    yu "I’m guessing that’s why she feels so indebted to me now. Why I get to live like a fuckin’ queen when all I did was teach her how to use a goddamn vending machine."

    yu "Then I fell in with the Yakuza. She got married to some rich guy. And we moved onto different worlds completely detached from one another. "
    yu "Which, honestly, is how it should’ve been from the start. I was nothing but a distraction for her. Would’ve dragged her down eventually and ruined her whole fuckin’ life, I’m sure."

    yu "She ain’t a bad person, Akira. One of the best I’ve ever met, really. You just don’t want to be on her bad side."
    s "Oh, I’m well aware of that. She just feels more like a puppeteer than a friend sometimes."

    yu "I ain’t gonna pretend to know everything about her or anything. But I know enough to tell you she ain’t a bad person. "
    yu "There’s a method to all the madness, I’m sure. So when she asks you to do something, just do it. Fighting her’s only gonna make shit harder for you in the long run."
