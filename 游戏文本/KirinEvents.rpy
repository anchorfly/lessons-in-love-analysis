    "Haruka Hamasaki was a human being living on a planet called “Earth.”"
    "And for a number of reasons, many of which she did not understand nor {i}care{/i} to understand, she was attracted to teenage girls."
    "Never in a million years did she think she’d be brazen enough to act on that. But after years of watching her master work his magic, she felt inspired enough to try pulling a rabbit from a hat."
    "Magic isn’t something that comes easy, though. It takes time and practice — and an audience both aloof and trusting enough to not ask questions."
    "Kirin Kanda, another human being living on the same planet as Haruka Hamasaki, was currently kicking herself for {i}not{/i} asking more questions."
    "She had come a long way in {i}different{/i} ways from Haruka lately. And it was a way she never would have come at all if excitement and curiosity did not light the path."
    "Unfortunately, once the lights of the bathroom she was dragged into were flicked off, these qualities could not find and guide her."
    "It was just dark. Darker {i}still{/i} in the confines of a tidy bathroom stall where she was subsequently pressed up against the door."
    "That was fine, though. For just like when she lost her virginity, she was content with being used because it meant someone wanted to use her."
    "She was mad too. Mad that {i}he{/i} wasn’t here to press her up against the door instead. Mad that he’d let someone else get to her when he knew the type of girl she was. "
    "Filthy."
    "Weak."
    "Undesirable."
    "Selfish."
    "And yet..."
    "And yet the temptation to {i}submit{/i} to temptation couldn’t match the power with which she longed to jostle the handle and free herself from this prison of her own creation."
    "But that, too, was a power insurmountable for a girl this weak — who’d given up long before mentioning giving up at all."
    "She would live in this cell — not thrive, but live — eating scraps passed through the bars and spreading her legs for “routine checks” because even that was better than sitting in silence."
    "Kirin Kanda was a human being living on a planet called “Earth” pressed up against the door of a dark bathroom stall who was filthy, weak, undesirable, selfish, and hated silence."
    "But screaming is unbecoming. And screaming would be a proclamation that she’s better than what she is when she knows that she is not."
    "So she just looks away and lets the woman who brought her here do the dirty work..."
    "Hoping that this, too, will be something she grows into."
    "And that the moment she’s found herself in is not a nightmare at all, for the nightmares come later."
    "This is something else."
    "This is purgatory."
