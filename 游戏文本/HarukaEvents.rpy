    "Haruka was dying. And it was Akira Arakawa and his unflappable manliness and very flappable wiener that was doing the killing."
    "Nobody would be charged for this homicide though as Haruka Hamasaki had already proclaimed earlier that she was currently seeking death and it’s not like she has anyone to press charges on her behalf anyway."
    "Perhaps this is just one of those “what goes around comes around” type things and this night is just her penance for all of her sins."
