    "The average human body’s chest cavity can withstand a little over 400 lbs of weight before being crushed, but there are several factors that could cause this number to fluctuate."
    "On September 18th of 1692, a man by the name of Giles Corey was executed by Captain John Gardner of Nantucket after being accused of and charged with witchcraft."
    "But what various historical texts and the acclaimed play adaptation “The Crucible” will not tell you is that there is a very specific reason Mr. Corey was able to withstand a number likely larger than 400 lbs."
    "Inside his chest cavity was a special worm."
    "The worm did not have a name, but it fed on the residue that seeped through Giles’ body until, after consuming enough, it began to grow teeth."
    "Giles Corey was an old man. An old man with a young worm. And the young worm wanted to be old one day."
    "So, while Mr. Corey was being pressed to death, it came up with a plan."
    "The worm hardened its body with the help of God as it had been saving up the religious power inadvertently stored by Giles Corey each time he prayed at night."
    "And while this allowed the young worm and the old man to survive slightly longer, it meant nothing in the face of the determined Captain John Gardner of Nantucket."
    "Eventually, the worm and Giles Corey would be crushed to death. And their bodies, still conjoined, would be dumped into a nearby river when their skin refused to burn."
    "But that isn’t the end of the story."
    "In fact, the story is still going on right now."
    "Because when the body of Giles Corey decomposed, so did the worm. And the leftover power of God that allowed the worm to harden its body was dispersed throughout the water."
    "By the time we found out, it was already too late."
    "We have all drunk from the water."
    "Now, we all have worms inside of us."
