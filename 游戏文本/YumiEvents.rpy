    "And, for the sake of the argument, let’s say the street ended there too."
    "What do you think would happen if you were to just walk off the edge?"
    "How long would you fall for?"
    "Would it be for the rest of eternity?"

    "We find shelter beneath a small wooden structure the staff here must use for storage. I don’t know. I’m thinking of other things at the moment."
    "Namely the fact that I’m stuck here with Yumi — a girl who, by all accounts, is meant to despise and abhor me no matter {i}what{/i} timeline we find ourselves stuck in."
    "Yet the only dry spot on my body is a space on my palm that she didn’t release until just a few seconds ago."
    "Her hand was smaller than I expected. But that’s probably just because I’ve never seen her as dainty or fragile even during moments like this where she unintentionally reminds me she’s just another teenage girl."
    "Neither one of us speaks for a staggering amount of time. We just look out at the ocean as it attempts to drown itself and silently contemplate just how long we’re willing to wait here for."
    "Forever would be fine. "

    "Because one time wouldn’t mean much. Two times means something. But what if it’s three or four or five or more and all of them have gone unnoticed because of what we are to one another?"
    "I don’t know {i}what{/i} to think anymore now that the threads are beginning to untangle. But while they loosen their hold on me, they tie harder around someone else."
    "And if I were Yumi right now, I’d be scared. I know that for sure because I {i}was{/i} Yumi once — back when none of this made sense and I struggled to fit my fingers through the noose around my neck."
